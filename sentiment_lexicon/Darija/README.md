Darija language is not supported by Google translate, so we did not translate sentiment lexicon for the language.

However, we filter our collected tweets using emotions and adjectives words since they may contains sentiments.

The Adjective and emotion words are obtained from here: https://github.com/darija-open-dataset/dataset
